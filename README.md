# Solar System Project

This project is a visual representation of the Solar System, built using HTML and CSS. It provides an interactive layout of the Solar System with each planet orbiting around the Sun and displays information about each planet through tooltips.

## Features

- **Visual Representation**: Planets are displayed in orbit around the Sun with animations that simulate orbital movement.
- **Planet Information Tooltips**: Hovering over each planet displays a tooltip containing key information, including:
  - Planet type
  - Diameter
  - Distance from the Sun
  - Temperature, atmosphere, rotation, and revolution details
- **Animations**: CSS animations simulate planetary orbits and enhance user engagement.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the Solar System layout, with each planet element nested within orbital paths and tooltip data for all planets.
- **style.css**: Contains styles for the solar system, including planetary shapes, animations, tooltips, and a background to represent space.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the Solar System simulation.

## Technical Details

- **HTML Structure**: Div elements represent each planet, the Sun, and the orbit paths.
- **CSS Animations**: Keyframes control the rotation and translation of each planet to create orbit effects.
- **Hover Tooltips**: Each planet includes a hoverable image that shows an informational tooltip on hover.
- **Background**: A space-themed background image (`Images/star.jpg`) sets the visual context.

## Project Requirements

- **Images Folder**: Ensure the project includes an `Images` directory with images for each planet (`sun.png`, `mercury.png`, `venus.png`, etc.) and the background (`star.jpg`).
- **Browser Support**: Optimized for modern browsers supporting CSS animations.
